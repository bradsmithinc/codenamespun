Top 10 things likely to be overheard if you had a Klingon on your software development team:

   1. This code is GAGH! You have no honor!
   2. A TRUE Klingon warrior does not comment his code!
   3. By filing this bug you have questioned my family honor. Prepare to die!
   4. You question the worthiness of my Code? I should kill you where you stand!
   5. Our competitors are without honor!
   6. Specs are for the weak and timid
   7. This machine is a piece of GAGH! I need an multi-processor ultra if I am to do battle!
   8. Perhaps it IS a good day to die! Let's ship it!
   9. My program has just dumped Stovo Core!
  10. Behold the keyboard of Kalis! The greatest Klingon code-warrior who ever lived!
